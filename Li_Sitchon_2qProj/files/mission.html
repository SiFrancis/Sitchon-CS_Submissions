        <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
        <h1 id="motto">"Connecting the World."</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our founder, Christopher Snow, believed that humanity's strongest asset was its ability to connect, communicate, and create with the power of collective knowledge. This belief led him to create HyperLink in 1994, seeing the potential of the Internet to revolutionize the way we connect. Since then, we've been striving to turn his vision into reality, with this motto as our guide to a better, more connected future.</p>

            <h3>EQUAL AND FREE INTERNET ACCESS FOR ALL</h3>
            <p>Even in the 90s, when HyperLink was founded,  it was clear that the Internet would lead to a "digital divide"; a new form of global inequality. We at HyperLink aim to bridge this gap once and for all.</p>

            <h3>GREATER DIGITAL LITERACY</h3>
            <p>For many, the Internet is still an unfamiliar landscape, making them easy targets for scams and fake news. In a more connected world, people must be more aware of how to better navigate the Internet, and avoid harmful content.</p>

            <h3>AN INTERNET OF THE PEOPLE</h3>
            <p>A concerning trend that has only grown in recent years is the huge influence of corporate interests on the Internet, and everyone on it. We believe that the Internet is a tool to be used for the good of all, not just for the interests of a select few.</p>
